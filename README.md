# Supplier News Categorization System

This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **MLOps principles** to automate the categorization of supplier-related news articles into predefined categories such as Financial, Geopolitical, Natural Disasters, and Regulatory. The system is deployed using **Streamlit** with **Docker** for an interactive, web-based user experience.

## ðŸš€ **Project Objectives**

1. Automate the categorization of supplier news articles to reduce manual effort.
2. Provide real-time data processing and categorization.
3. Enable scalability and reliability through cloud deployment and MLOps practices.
4. Implement robust data security and ensure adaptability through automated retraining pipelines.

## ðŸ“Š **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection**: News articles are scraped from multiple sources and stored securely in **Azure Blob Storage**.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Text data is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed for model training.
3. **Model Training**: Various machine learning models, including **BERT**, are trained and validated.
4. **Deployment**: The model is containerized using **Docker** and deployed with **Streamlit** for interactive use.
5. **Monitoring & Retraining**: Model performance is monitored using **Azure Application Insights**, with automated retraining pipelines for continuous improvement.
