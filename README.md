# Supplier News Categorization Using NLP

This repository contains the code and resources for my Final Year Project titled **"Supplier News Categorization using NLP Algorithms and Techniques."** The project focuses on developing a system that categorizes supplier-related news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

Supplier-related news is crucial for organizations to make informed decisions. This project aims to streamline the process by creating a benchmark dataset and implementing machine learning models for automatic categorization of supplier news articles. The core steps include web scraping for data collection, dataset creation, and building various NLP models for categorization.

### Key Features
- **Web Scraping:** Automated scraping of supplier news articles from various online sources to create a dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, tokenizing, and preprocessing of textual data to prepare it for model training.
- **Categorization Models:** Implementation of various NLP models (e.g., TF-IDF + Naive Bayes, BERT, etc.) for categorizing the news articles.
- **Evaluation:** Comparison of different models to identify the best-performing algorithm based on standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Benchmark Dataset

The benchmark dataset created for this project is available in the `data/processed/` directory. It consists of scraped news articles categorized by relevant supplier-related topics. The dataset can be used for training and testing NLP models.

## NLP Techniques Used

- **TF-IDF + Naive Bayes:** A traditional approach using term frequency-inverse document frequency for feature extraction and Naive Bayes for classification.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** A state-of-the-art transformer-based model for text categorization.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):** Recurrent neural network architecture used for text sequence classification.
